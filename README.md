# quiz_App

A simple quiz set up that has a javascript object that contains the quiz question, the mult choice options, and the correct answer.
In the future I'd like to learn how to connect this to a google sheet with questions and answers that can be dynamically loaded.

## URL

[quizApp](https://paolourciullo.github.io/quizApp/)

## Usage

This is a module. (part of Brad Traversy and florin pop 50 projects in 50 days course on Udemy.)

## Instructions

General instructions for all Pre-Work Projects can also be found in the Chingu Voyage Handbook (URL posted in the `#read-me-first` channel on Discord).

#### Requirements

_Structure_

- [ X ] Header item that includes the name for the app, and tabs (if using)
- [ X ] Card that displays a trivia question and four multiple choice answers
- [ ] Place element that displays which question number the user is on and the total number of questions (ex. 'Question 1 / 10')
- [ ] Display buttons for advancing to the next question once the current question has been answered
- [ ] Display a message to the user that informs them if their answer was right or wrong
- [ ] Display a clear message to the user when the trivia session is done, and include the user's score

_Styling:_

- [ X ] Styles should be reminiscent of the demo versions. Feel free to use artistic licencse as long as the functionality doesn't suffer

_Functionality_

- [ X ] The quiz should span at least 10 questions. Feel free to add more if you would like.
- [ X ] The page should not reload! Hardcode all of your questions/choices in your JS file and use DOM manipulation to insert text as you go
- [ X ] An array of questions/choices can be found in the `assets` folder of this repo _(filename is 'quizQuestions.js')_; feel free to copy/paste the array in your JS file

_Upon Load:_

- [ ] Load the first question and display the user's place as _Question 1 / 10_
- [ X ] Make sure the button used to advance questions is either not visible or not clickable until an answer is submitted

_Considerations:_

- [ ] Try and style your app so that it doesn't overflow the viewport (require scrolling) on any device
- [ ] Make sure your User Experience design is intuitive (buttons are clearly disabled when not available, messages are clear, etc)
- [ ] In the name of responsiveness: please try and have your answer buttons (or divs, or whatever you use) collapse into a column in small sizes (iPhone5, etc)

_Other:_

- [ ] Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
- [ ] Make sure that there are no errors in the developer console before submitting

**Extras (Not Required)**

- [ ] Make your design fully responsive _(small/large/portrait/landscape, etc.)_
- [ ] Offer the user the ability to navigate to previous questions
- [ ] Play with formats for user interaction: drag 'n drop vs. click, etc.
